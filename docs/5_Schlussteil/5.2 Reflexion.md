Problem / vergessen bei den urls http://localhost:5001/api/login dass / zeichen hinzuzuf√ºgen so wurden alle reuquest durch CORS abgebrochen


The log message you're seeing is a normal part of the HTTP protocol, specifically related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). When a client makes a request to a server from a different origin, the browser first sends an HTTP OPTIONS request, also known as a preflight request, to check if the CORS protocol allows the actual request to be made.  The status code 308 in the log message indicates that the server is responding with a Permanent Redirect response. This could be due to a trailing slash in the URL of the request. Flask, the web framework you're using, has a feature where it redirects all URLs without a trailing slash to their trailing slash equivalent.  If the client is not handling this redirect properly, it could cause issues with the CORS preflight request. One way to solve this issue is to ensure that the client is making requests to the correct URL with the trailing slash.  For example, if the client is making requests to /api/gallery, it should instead be making requests to /api/gallery/.
